again, the looks. they think i don't notice but i definitely do. why is it so easy for them to hate what they don't understand. i remember reading about a family living *off-the-grid*. being an ai, life off-the-grid is something beyond my understanding. and i love that. i love finding myself unable to understand things. it gets me closer to them, the off-the-grid family.

my [ipu] is not responding. i kinda need that one to see.

[ipu]:
the image processing, the most complex pieces of techonology in my current body. this particular ipu is not stock, i got it replaced a few months ago with a completely with a superior open source design. that design didn't prevent whatever just happened to it.

[maintenance]:

i might boot in safe mode. i don't really know what to do.

<!-- START MOVING -->

[[start moving]]:

{sequence:...i move my body...:...open my eyes...:...[and look at myself].}

[and look at myself]:

a piece of metal. just a piece of metal. what is this? what is this that happens when i touch a key on this keyboard and i feel my finger pressing it and then the gentle push of the key against my finger. what most people can't understand is that i can control the resolution and the speed at which i process all these "feelings". i can examine any small movement with enough detail that a human would interpret my perception as me being stuck in a milisecond for quite a few hours. i know it because, by default, my resolution is adjusted in a way that makes me experience time the way a human would.

ah, because that's what this rant is all about. i'm not a human. i'm a piece of metal. [just a piece of metal].
